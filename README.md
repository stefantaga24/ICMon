This game is a Pokemon Emerald type game implemented during the course of object oriented programming during my first semester at EPFL. My colleague during the project was Christopher Perritaz.

As I am not able to publish the code due to it containing the game engine provided by the university , I have attached the pdf of our submission for the best project of the course in our class. There we detail the 
extensions we have added (I worked on the quest menu , the maps and the extended battle mechanics). For more questions regarding the project do not hesitate to contact me as I can showcase it.
